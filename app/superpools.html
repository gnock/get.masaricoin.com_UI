				<p><b>Welcome Superpools Masari Miners!</b>  </p>
              <p>We have worked with @Dani to make the transition from Superpools  to Masaricoin as seamless as possible.  Some things may look a bit different, but we  have many similarities.  Masaricoin contributes  the same amount to the Masari Devs as Superpools did.  Like Superpools, Masaricoin is trusted by the  Devs, and the Masari community.  </p>
              <p>Masaricoin is dedicated to Masari.  We do not mine any other coins.  We have 4 pool operators geo-located so  support is available almost 24/7.  The  Masaricoin discord community has grown considerably and if a pool operator  doesn&rsquo;t answer quickly, it&rsquo;s likely someone else will offer help.  Also, one of our pool operators is on the  Core Dev team! </p>
              <p>Some new things….   Masaricoin is a different from Superpools in the following ways:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>PPLNS Payment System – This feature discourages  pool hopping and rewards loyal miners</li>
                <li>Email Alerts – Your worker goes down, you get an  email letting you know</li>
                <li>Sub-Address Support – You can mine with  Sub-Addresses</li>
                <li>Geo-Servers – We have servers located in  Singapore, Germany, and the US.  Using pool.masaricoin.com  will route you to the nearest node for less latency.</li>
                <li>Customizable payout threshold and lower minimum  payout level – Set your payout threshold to anywhere you like above 1 MSR.  Keep in mind, we eat the fees if you are  equal to or greater than 20 MSR.</li>
                <li>Config Generators – Sometimes these config changes  get frustrating.  Just stop by our config  generator and pull the most up to date configs!</li>
                <li>Discord – We have a very active Discord  community.  We are implementing a tip/lottery  bot at the fork.  Very cool stuff, come  check it out..</li>
              </ul>
              <p>Change is sometimes hard, but we at Masaricoin are prepared  to help in anyway possible to make things as smooth as possible.  </p>
